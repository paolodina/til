# View All My Comments On GitHub Issues

Visit: <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+commenter%3A%40me+sort%3Aupdated-desc>

## Explained

- <https://github.com/issues> lists all issues on GitHub
- Filter by `is:issue commenter:@me sort:updated-desc`
  - `commenter:@me` dynamically always filters by the logged in user (you could
  also replace `@me` with your actual username)
  - `sort:updated-desc` the default sort is based on Newest which looks at issue
  creation date. Setting to sort by updated means issues with the most recent
  posts will appear first (this is what I expected the default to be)
